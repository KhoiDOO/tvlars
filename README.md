<p align="justify">LARS and LAMB have emerged as prominent techniques in Large Batch Learning (LBL), ensuring the stability of AI training. One of the primary challenges in LBL is stabilizing convergence, where the AI agent is usually get trapped in the sharp minimizer. Addressing this challenge, a relatively recent technique, known as warmup, has been employed. However, it's worth noting that warmup lacks a strong theoretical foundation, leaving the door open for further exploration of more efficacious algorithms. In light of this situation, we conducted empirical experiments to analyze the behaviors of the two most popular optimizers in the LARS family: LARS and LAMB, with and without a warm-up strategy. Our analysis gives us a comprehension of the novel LARS, LAMB, and the necessity of a warmup technique in LBL. Building upon these insights, we propose a novel algorithm called Time Varying LARS (TVLARS), which facilitates robust training in the initial phase without the need for warm-up. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TVLARS achieves competitive results with LARS and LAMB when warm-up is utilized while surpassing their performance without the warm-up technique.</p>
